## Overview

This repository contains a single-page application (SPA) that renders a complete, multi-section marketing landing page. The page is structured as a vertical scroll experience composed of distinct, purpose-built sections: a fixed navigation bar, a full-screen hero, an about section with key statistics, a support/contact section, an all-in-one platform features section, a pricing tier section, and a footer with link columns, an email newsletter signup, and social media links.

All sections communicate via smooth scroll anchors powered by `react-scroll`, and the entire page is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Tailwind CSS utility classes and CSS Grid.

The codebase enforces strict TypeScript compilation — every file is type-checked with no implicit `any`, strict null checks, no unused variables or parameters, and no unreachable code. This approach ensures long-term maintainability and makes onboarding new contributors straightforward, since the compiler catches entire categories of bugs at build time.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive Layout** — adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and widescreen desktop using Tailwind CSS breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`).
- **Fixed Navigation Bar** — stays pinned to the top of the viewport on scroll with a drop shadow. Includes a hamburger menu that toggles a slide-in drawer on small screens.
- **Smooth Scroll Navigation** — all nav links use `react-scroll` to animate the page to the corresponding section rather than performing a hard jump.
- **Hero Section** — full-screen landing area with a heading, call-to-action, a hero image, and a row of service icon chips (App Security, Dashboard Design, Cloud Data, API).
- **About Section** — highlights key business metrics (100% Completion, 24/7 Delivery, 100% Transactions) in bold stat cards alongside descriptive copy and a feature list.
- **Support Section** — full-bleed background image section with floating cards for Sales, Technical Support, and General Inquiries, each with a "Contact Us" call-to-action.
- **Platform Section** — "All-In-One Platform" feature grid showcasing four platform capabilities with checkmark icons.
- **Pricing Section** — two-tier pricing layout (Standard and Premium) with feature checklists using a reusable `CheckMark` component.
- **Footer** — four link columns (Solutions, Company, Legal, Support), an email newsletter subscription input, a dynamic copyright year, and social media icon links.
- **Perfect Lighthouse Score** — optimized for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
- **Strict TypeScript** — full strict mode compilation with zero tolerance for implicit types, unused symbols, or unreachable code.
- **Automated Dependency Management** — Dependabot keeps npm packages and GitHub Actions up to date on a monthly schedule, with an automerge workflow that handles patch and minor updates automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system.

### Node.js and npm

This project requires **Node.js 18 or higher** and a compatible version of npm. The build toolchain (`react-scripts`) and all dependencies assume a modern Node.js runtime.

To check your current versions:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If you do not have Node.js installed, download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). It is recommended to use a version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Linux/macOS) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (Windows) to manage multiple Node.js versions.

### Git

Git is required to clone the repository.

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Optional: GitHub CLI

The `gh` CLI is used by the automerge GitHub Actions workflow. You do not need it to run or develop the project locally, but it is useful if you plan to interact with the repository's pull requests from the command line.

---

## Installation

Follow these steps exactly to get the project running locally from scratch.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/milliorn/cloud-landing-page.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd cloud-landing-page
```

### Step 3: Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and installs every runtime and development dependency into the `node_modules/` directory. The lock file guarantees that every developer and every CI environment installs the exact same dependency versions.

> **Note:** Do not delete `package-lock.json`. It ensures reproducible installs across all environments. If you need to update dependencies, use `npm update` or let Dependabot handle it via pull requests.

---

## Running the Development Server

Once installation is complete, start the local development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This launches the Create React App development server. Open your browser and navigate to:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The development server provides:

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** — the browser automatically reloads when you save changes to any source file.
- **React Strict Mode** — components are rendered twice in development to surface side effects. This is intentional and does not affect production builds.
- **Inline error overlay** — TypeScript and ESLint errors appear as an overlay in the browser, making it unnecessary to constantly watch the terminal.
- **Source maps** — browser developer tools map minified code back to the original TypeScript source files, enabling straightforward debugging.

> **Port conflict:** If port 3000 is already in use, CRA will prompt you to start on the next available port. Alternatively, you can set a custom port by prefixing the command: `PORT=3001 npm start` (Linux/macOS) or `set PORT=3001 && npm start` (Windows cmd).

---

## Available Scripts

All scripts are defined in `package.json` under the `"scripts"` key and invoked via `npm run <script-name>`.

### `npm start`

Starts the Webpack development server on `http://localhost:3000`. The server watches all files under `src/` for changes and performs hot reloads.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the application into an optimized static bundle in the `build/` directory. The production build performs:

- Minification of JavaScript and CSS
- Tree-shaking to eliminate unused code
- Content hashing of output filenames for effective long-term browser caching
- Image and asset optimization

The `build/` directory is self-contained and can be served by any static file server or CDN.

### `npm run predeploy`

This script runs **automatically** before `npm run deploy`. It executes `npm run build` to ensure a fresh production build exists before deployment. You do not need to call this manually.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the contents of the `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository using the `gh-pages` npm package. GitHub Pages serves the site from that branch.

Full deployment sequence:

```bash
npm run deploy
# Internally runs: npm run predeploy && gh-pages -d build
# Which runs:      npm run build    && gh-pages -d build
```

After the command completes, the live site at `https://milliorn.github.io/cloud-landing-page/` will reflect the new build within a few minutes.

### `npm test`

Launches the Jest test runner in interactive watch mode. Tests are co-located with source files following the CRA convention (`*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx` files).

### `npm run eject`

**This is a one-way, irreversible operation.** Ejecting copies the full Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and Jest configuration out of `react-scripts` and into the project root, giving you full manual control. Only eject if you have a specific configuration requirement that cannot be accomplished through CRA's supported override mechanisms. There is no undo.

### `npm run tsc:build`

Runs the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) against `tsconfig.json` with `--noEmit`, meaning it performs a full type check of the entire `src/` directory but does not produce any output files. Use this to confirm that the codebase is type-clean without running a full Webpack build.

```bash
npm run tsc:build
```

If there are no type errors, the command exits silently with code 0. Any type errors are printed to stdout with file path, line number, and a descriptive message.

### `npm run tsc:watch`

Same as `tsc:build` but runs in watch mode — the TypeScript compiler stays active and re-checks all files on every save. This is useful as a companion process alongside `npm start` to get type error feedback in the terminal rather than only in the browser overlay.

```bash
npm run tsc:watch
```

### `test:tsc`

An alias for `tsc -p tsconfig.json -w` — equivalent to `tsc:watch`. This is the watch mode variant used during active development.

---

## Component Architecture

The application follows a **flat, section-based component hierarchy**. `App.tsx` is the root component and directly renders each page section in document order. Each section lives in its own subdirectory under `src/components/` and is broken into smaller, focused sub-components.

### Key Design Patterns

#### Data-driven rendering with `as const`

Several components define their content as `const` arrays marked with `as const`, then map over them to produce JSX. This keeps content and presentation clearly separated and makes it easy to update copy without touching component logic. For example, the Hero section defines its service chips as:

```tsx
const data = [
  { component: <CloudUpload ... />, p: "App Security" },
  { component: <Database ... />,   p: "Dashboard Design" },
  { component: <Server ... />,     p: "Cloud Data" },
  { component: <PaperAirplane .../>, p: "API" },
] as const;
```

#### Stable list keys with `react-uuid`

React requires a stable, unique `key` prop on every element produced by a `map`. This project uses `react-uuid` to generate a UUID for each mapped element, avoiding the anti-pattern of using the array index as a key.

#### Section anchors for smooth scroll

Each top-level section component renders a root `<div>` with an `id` attribute (`id="home"`, `id="about"`, `id="support"`, `id="platforms"`, `id="pricing"`). The `react-scroll` `Link` component in the navbar targets these IDs, animating the scroll position when a nav link is clicked.

#### Reusable `CheckMark` component

The `CheckMark` component (`src/components/CheckMark.tsx`) renders a single row consisting of a checkmark icon and a text string. It is used throughout the Pricing section to render feature lists, demonstrating the principle of extracting even small UI patterns into reusable primitives.

---

## Configuration

### TypeScript Configuration

`tsconfig.json` configures the TypeScript compiler with strict settings appropriate for a production React application.

```json
{
  "compileOnSave": true,
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "allowUnreachableCode": false,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "jsx": "react",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "checkJs": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Notable settings explained:

| Option | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `strict: true` | Enables the full suite of strict type-checking options as a single flag |
| `noImplicitAny` | Variables must have an explicit type; TypeScript will not silently infer `any` |
| `strictNullChecks` | `null` and `undefined` are not assignable to other types without explicit handling |
| `noUnusedLocals` | The compiler errors on declared-but-unused local variables |
| `noUnusedParameters` | The compiler errors on declared-but-unused function parameters |
| `allowUnreachableCode: false` | The compiler errors on code that can never be reached |
| `isolatedModules` | Every file must be a module; required by Babel's per-file transpilation |
| `noEmit: true` | TypeScript performs type checking only; Webpack/Babel handles transpilation |
| `target: "es5"` | Output targets ES5 for maximum browser compatibility |
| `sourceMap: true` | Generates `.map` files for debugging in browser DevTools |

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

`tailwind.config.js` configures Tailwind's content scanning and theme extension.

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

The `content` array tells Tailwind which files to scan for class names during the build. In production, Tailwind's JIT engine removes all unused utility classes, keeping the final CSS bundle minimal. All class names used anywhere in `src/` are preserved; everything else is purged.

To extend the theme (add custom colors, fonts, spacing, etc.), add values inside `theme.extend`. Custom values added there merge with and extend Tailwind's defaults rather than replacing them.

### PostCSS Configuration

`postcss.config.js` defines the CSS processing pipeline applied to every stylesheet.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-import': {},
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
```

The plugins run in the order listed:

1. **`postcss-import`** — resolves `@import` statements in CSS files, inlining the imported stylesheets before any other processing occurs.
2. **`tailwindcss`** — processes Tailwind's `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` directives, generating the complete utility class output.
3. **`autoprefixer`** — reads the project's `browserslist` targets from `package.json` and inserts vendor-prefixed CSS properties (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`) where needed for compatibility.

---

## Styling Conventions

### Utility-First with Tailwind

All layout, spacing, color, and typography decisions are expressed as Tailwind utility classes applied directly to JSX elements. There are no separate SCSS or CSS module files per component.

### Base Layer Overrides

`src/index.css` uses Tailwind's `@layer base` directive to apply opinionated global defaults to HTML elements:

```css
@layer base {
  li {
    @apply p-4;
  }

  button {
    @apply text-white border bg-indigo-600 border-indigo-600
           hover:bg-transparent hover:text-indigo-600 rounded-md;
  }
}
```

This means every `<button>` element in the application inherits the indigo brand color and hover behavior without needing to repeat those classes on each element individually. Overrides for specific buttons can be applied by adding more specific utility classes at the component level.

### Responsive Breakpoints

Tailwind's mobile-first breakpoints are used throughout:

| Prefix | Minimum Width |
| --- | --- |
| _(none)_ | 0px (mobile) |
| `sm:` | 640px |
| `md:` | 768px |
| `lg:` | 1024px |
| `xl:` | 1280px |

Components use class patterns such as `grid md:grid-cols-2` (single column on mobile, two columns on tablet and above) and `hidden md:flex` (hidden on mobile, flex on tablet and above).

---

## Deployment

This project deploys to **GitHub Pages** using the `gh-pages` npm package. The deployment target is the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.

### One-Command Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This single command:

1. Runs `npm run build` (via the `predeploy` hook) to produce the optimized production bundle in `build/`.
2. Pushes the contents of `build/` to the `gh-pages` branch using `gh-pages -d build`.
3. GitHub Pages picks up the new commit on `gh-pages` and serves it at the configured URL.

### Homepage URL

The `homepage` field in `package.json` must match the GitHub Pages URL. The `react-scripts` build process uses this value to set the correct public URL for all asset paths (images, JS chunks, CSS) in the production build. If you fork this repository and deploy to your own GitHub Pages account, update this URL accordingly.

### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain with GitHub Pages:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `public/` directory containing your domain (e.g., `example.com`).
2. Configure your DNS provider to point to GitHub's Pages servers.
3. Enable the custom domain in the repository's **Settings → Pages** section.
4. Update the `homepage` value in `package.json` to your custom domain.

---

## CI/CD and Dependency Management

### Dependabot

`.github/dependabot.yml` configures GitHub's Dependabot service to automatically open pull requests when newer versions of dependencies are available.

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"

  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    ignore:
      - dependency-name: "*"
        update-types: ["version-update:semver-major"]
```

Dependabot scans both npm packages and GitHub Actions dependencies monthly. Major version bumps for npm packages are ignored — these require manual review due to the potential for breaking changes. Patch and minor updates are automatically submitted as pull requests.

### Automerge Workflow

`.github/workflows/automerge.yml` runs on every pull request opened by `dependabot[bot]`. It uses the `dependabot/fetch-metadata` action to determine the semver update type and takes one of three actions:

| Update Type | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `semver-patch` or `semver-minor` | Auto-approves the PR and enables squash merge |
| `semver-major` | Creates a `dependabot-major-auto-closed` label, closes the PR, and posts a comment explaining why |
| null / empty update type | Creates a `dependabot-update-type-null` label, closes the PR, and posts a comment |

This keeps the `main` branch current with low-risk dependency updates without requiring manual intervention for every patch release.

---

## Browser Support

Browser targets are defined in `package.json` under the `"browserslist"` key.

Production:

- Browsers with greater than 0.2% global usage share
- Excludes browsers classified as "dead" (no official support or updates for 24+ months)
- Excludes Opera Mini

Development:

- Last 1 version of Chrome
- Last 1 version of Firefox
- Last 1 version of Safari

These targets are consumed by both `autoprefixer` (to determine which CSS vendor prefixes to add) and `@babel/preset-env` (to determine which JavaScript syntax transforms to apply).

---

- All new code must be written in TypeScript. No plain `.js` files in `src/`.
- TypeScript must compile cleanly with no errors (`npm run tsc:build`).
- Follow the existing component structure: one directory per section, one `index.tsx` as the section root, sub-components in the same directory.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling. Do not introduce new CSS files unless strictly necessary.
- Do not use array indices as React `key` props. Use `react-uuid` consistent with the rest of the codebase.
